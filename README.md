# Pytorch implementation of **[ELU-Net: An Efficient and Lightweight U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9745574)**

## Intro
The authors proposed "an eficient and lightweight
U-Net (ELU-Net) with deep skip connections." with main contributions being:

- "devising a novel ELU-Net to make full use of the full-scale features from the encoder by introducing deep skip connections, which incorporate same and large-scale feature maps of the encoder."
